# BMI Calculator

This website has a very simple function. After the user inputs
their height and weight their BMI (Body Mass Index) gets
calculated and they get appropriate feedback. The feedback gives
some tips how the user can improve their health and what they
should do. This project was made with the help of an external
library called progressbarjs and SASS.
